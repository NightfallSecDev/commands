## üîê HTTP Security Headers ‚Äî Deep Dive with Attack Mapping

| **Header** | **Purpose** | **If Missing or Misconfigured** | **Related Vulnerabilities & Abuse Scenarios** |
|------------|-------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `Content-Security-Policy` | Restrict what content the browser loads. | Inline scripts, external script abuse | ‚úÖ XSS (Reflected, Stored) <br> ‚úÖ Data Injection <br> ‚úÖ JS-based Keyloggers |
| `X-Frame-Options: DENY / SAMEORIGIN` | Prevents embedding in iframes. | Page can be loaded inside an attacker's iframe | ‚úÖ Clickjacking <br> ‚úÖ UI Redress Attacks |
| `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS) | Force HTTPS, protect against MITM. | Browser may fall back to HTTP | ‚úÖ SSL Stripping <br> ‚úÖ MITM (Man-In-The-Middle) |
| `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` | Prevent MIME sniffing by browsers. | Browser may treat a file as a different type | ‚úÖ MIME Sniffing <br> ‚úÖ Stored XSS via file upload |
| `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` *(Deprecated)* | Enable browser XSS filter. | May allow reflected XSS | ‚úÖ Reflected XSS (bypassable) |
| `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` | Controls which domains can make cross-origin requests. | Overly broad or wildcard CORS | ‚úÖ CORS Bypass <br> ‚úÖ Sensitive Data Theft (e.g., tokens, emails) |
| `Referrer-Policy` | Limit what referrer info is leaked in requests. | Full referrer info can leak URLs, tokens | ‚úÖ Information Disclosure <br> ‚úÖ Token/ID leakage |
| `Permissions-Policy` *(Feature-Policy)* | Disable sensitive APIs (camera, mic, fullscreen, etc.) | Attacker can access features like camera, mic | ‚úÖ Privacy Violations <br> ‚úÖ Drive-by Exploits |
| `Cache-Control: no-store` | Prevents sensitive data caching. | Sensitive data may remain in browser cache | ‚úÖ Credential Leak <br> ‚úÖ Session Replay via cache |
| `Set-Cookie: Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict` | Secure cookies against JS access and CSRF. | Cookies can be stolen or used cross-site | ‚úÖ XSS (Cookie Theft) <br> ‚úÖ CSRF Attacks |
| `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy` | Control who can load resources from the origin. | Data may be leaked to third parties | ‚úÖ Resource Hijack <br> ‚úÖ Data Leakage |
| `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` | Prevents speculative side-channel attacks. | Shared memory leaks can occur | ‚úÖ Spectre-like Attacks <br> ‚úÖ Side-channel Timing Attacks |
| `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` | Isolates browsing contexts. | Can allow attackers to use shared memory & manipulate windows | ‚úÖ Tabnabbing <br> ‚úÖ Side-Channel Attacks |
| `Expect-CT` | Helps enforce Certificate Transparency logging. | Fake certs could be used undetected | ‚úÖ MITM via Forged Certificates |
| `Feature-Policy` (Deprecated, replaced by Permissions-Policy) | Restrict browser features per origin. | Exploitation of sensors, camera, fullscreen | ‚úÖ Hardware Abuse <br> ‚úÖ Drive-by Downloads |

## üß™ Real-World Exploits Based on Missing Headers

| Scenario | Exploited Header | Attack |
|---------|------------------|--------|
| A user uploads an image, but attacker uploads a `.html` file instead, which browser executes | Missing `X-Content-Type-Options` | Stored XSS via file upload |
| Site uses `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, exposing private API | Misconfigured CORS header | Data leakage via malicious JavaScript |
| Site allows iframe embedding | Missing `X-Frame-Options` | Clickjacking attack to trick users |
| No CSP & allows inline scripts | Missing `Content-Security-Policy` | Stored XSS via comment form |
| Site doesn‚Äôt use HSTS | Missing `Strict-Transport-Security` | SSL Downgrade Attack (e.g., via Evil Twin Wi-Fi) |
